<h1>About...</h1>
<article>
<p> I am a recent graduate of the University of Miami, with a degree in Broadcast Journalism. I am a Production Specialist with a focus in live sports. Creatively and technically experienced with live events varying from direction of ESPN3 events to replay operation of MLS soccer matches.</p>

<br><p>While attending college at the University of Miami, I was able to experience a wide array of live production enviroments. Starting within the University's athletic department as a production assistant, allowed other doors to be open for me professionally. Vista Worldlink is a production company that I currently freelance at, and it has given me even more experience in a live sports enviroment.</p></br>

<p> As a producer of Sportsdesk, a student run thirty minute long weekly program, I was able to sharpen more of skills, especially related to video editing. Also through this position, I was able to learn leadership and management skills, as I had to correspond and coordinate various tasks for over twenty-five students. </p>
